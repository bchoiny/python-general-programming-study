# python-general-programming-study

This repo is for general (non-data science) Python programming projects and guided exercises from online courses and books. Projects I independently work on will have their own repo.

I will be using these courses and books to learn more about Python programming outside DS space:

1. Udemy - Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3 (Progress: 100%)  
  a. Milestone Project 1 - to be updated  
  b. Milestone Project 2 - to be updated  
  c. Final Capstone Project - to be updated  
  
2-1. Udemy - Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming (Progress: 0%)  
2-2. Book - Automate the Boring Stuff with Python  


Ultimately, I want to be a good enough Python programmer to comfortably write programs, collaborate with others, and make useful libraries other will want to use. One thing I'm really interested in doing is making Python version of actuar R pkg (https://github.com/cran/actuar) and other actuarial libraries like chainladder.
